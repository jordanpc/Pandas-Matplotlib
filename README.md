# Pandas-Matplotlib
# Pyber Ride Sharing Data (Pandas-Matplotlib)

# Observed Trend 1: As you travel from Rural to Suburban to Urban, average fare per ride decreases.

# Observed Trend 2: As you travel from Rural to Suburban to Urban, total number of rides (per city) increases.

# Observed Trend 3: Urban makes up more than 3/4 (77.8%) of total drivers, however, makes up less than 2/3 (62.0%) of total fares, which means Urban drivers earn the lowest average fares per ride.
